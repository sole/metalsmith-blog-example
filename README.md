# Metalsmith blog example

> An example of using [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io/) as static blog generator

Use as guide, as starting point, however you want.

Clone or get the ZIP, then make sure to run `npm install` before anything else, to get dependencies installed.

* Blog contents are in the `src` folder.
* Templates are defined in the `layouts` folder.

Edit everything to make it your own!

## Commands

* `npm run start` will build the blog into `build`
* `npm run watch` will build the blog, start an http server serving pages from `build` so you can test locally. It also sets a file watcher to rebuild the blog as you make changes to the files, without having to manually initiate the rebuilds.
